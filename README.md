- Excel Data Cleaning and Creating Reports

### Findings

- Customer Satisfaction Rate: 42%, which is relatively low and may indicate a need for improvement in service or product quality.
- There is a general upward trend in customer numbers compared to last year.
- Significant growth is visible from August to October, peaking around October.
- Customer numbers for most months are still below last year’s figures, except in Oct–Dec where they slightly converge.
- The sales target is consistent across months (~486), shown in blue.
- Peak performance occurred in August (490), the only month exceeding the target


### Recommendations

- Customer Satisfaction (42%) is a concern and should be prioritized for improvement.
- Despite high sales, profit margins are low (R647 on R4,550 sales = ~14% profit margin).
- Focus on improving underperforming months (e.g., March and May).
- Consider analyzing customer feedback to boost satisfaction and loyalty.
